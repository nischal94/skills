**Production-grade agent skills — map your unknowns before you build, prove you understand what shipped, turn work into artifacts people read, and transcribe any video offline.**

Skills are focused instruction sets that an agent loads on demand. Each one packages a proven workflow — with its checklists, output formats, and guardrails — so you get the same high-quality result every time, in any project, without re-explaining your process.

Built for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), portable by format: every skill is a standard `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (the open Agent Skills convention), so any agent or installer that reads the format can use them. A few skills use Claude Code affordances — the Artifact tool, sandbox flags — and fall back to local equivalents elsewhere.

## Quick start

**Install as a plugin in Claude Code (recommended):**

```
/plugin marketplace add nischal94/skills
```

**Or install manually:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nischal94/skills.git ~/.claude/skills/skills
```

**Then invoke any skill by name:**

```
/blindspot I'm adding a new auth provider and I don't know this part of the codebase.
```

## The skills

### Understanding & workflow

Four skills that operationalize one discipline: *surface what you don't know before implementing, and prove you understand what shipped before merging.*

#### `blindspot` — find your unknown unknowns first

Pre-implementation reconnaissance. **Codebase mode** explores the target area and produces blindspot cards — each names a pothole you didn't know existed, why it bites, the evidence, and a copyable prompt-fix — ending with a four-quadrant map of the task and one assembled implementation prompt. **Domain mode** teaches you the vocabulary of an unfamiliar field (color grading, backpressure, auth flows) until you can specify what you want.

```
/blindspot Codebase mode. Target: the policy engine I'm about to build.
I've read the spec but never touched the surrounding modules.
```

#### `explain-diff` — understand a change before you merge it

Turns any diff, commit, or PR into a rich HTML explainer: background on the surrounding system, the intuition behind the change, a literate walkthrough in narrative order — and a five-question quiz at the end. The rule that gives it teeth: **don't merge a load-bearing change until you pass the quiz fully.**

```
/explain-diff PR #42 — I need to actually understand the streaming logic before I merge.
```

#### `teach-me` — explain it back before you move on

Teaches you the work done in the current session — a fix, a change, a decision — until you can explain it yourself. It asks for your own explanation first, answers gaps with hints before explanations, drills the why, and checks each point with a multiple-choice question. A checklist tracks what you have shown you understand; an item is ticked only when you answer its check question correctly, never on the teacher's say-so.

```
/teach-me the retry logic we just changed
```

#### `pitch` — one document that gets the work approved

Assembles your prototype, spec, implementation notes, and diff into a single demo-led buy-in doc: the working thing first, then what and why, evidence, every reviewer objection pre-answered, and the exact ask with named sign-offs.

```
/pitch Package the prototype, the spec, and the deviations log into one doc for sign-off.
```

### Transcription

Two complementary skills behind one routing rule: *captions when they exist, offline speech-to-text when they don't.* Each skill's description points at the other, so the agent picks correctly without overlap.

#### `yt-transcript` — YouTube, in seconds

Downloads the video's existing caption track (creator-uploaded preferred, auto-generated fallback) with yt-dlp, strips VTT timestamps and entities, deduplicates the rolling caption windows, and saves clean prose. No model, no transcription — captions download in seconds.

```
/yt-transcript https://youtube.com/watch?v=... — get me the transcript.
```

#### `media-transcript` — everything without captions, fully offline

X/Twitter posts, podcasts, direct media links — anything yt-dlp reaches that has no caption track. Extracts audio and transcribes locally with whisper.cpp; the audio never leaves your machine. Hardened by construction: the whisper model is SHA-256-pinned and verified before every run, URLs are treated as untrusted input, livestreams are timeout-guarded, and audio past ~20 minutes asks before committing your CPU.

```
/media-transcript https://x.com/user/status/... — transcript please.
```

### Creation & design

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| [`html-to-image`](./html-to-image/) | Convert HTML files to high-resolution PNG or JPEG using Puppeteer and system Chrome — no browser download required. |
| [`design-eng`](./design-eng/) | UI polish, component design, animation decisions, and the invisible details that make software feel great. |
| [`product-explainer`](./product-explainer/) | A story-driven HTML slide deck that explains your product to a non-technical audience — grounded in the real docs and codebase, no invented features. |

## How skills work

Skills load in three tiers, so they cost almost nothing until used:

1. **Metadata scan** (~100 tokens) — name and description, always loaded, lets the agent know the skill exists
2. **Full `SKILL.md`** — loaded only on invocation
3. **Referenced sub-files** — loaded on demand

`blindspot`, `explain-diff`, and `pitch` publish their output as self-contained HTML — via the Claude Code Artifact tool when available, or as a local HTML file otherwise. No external dependencies either way.

## Contributing & security

- **Contributing:** skills follow a consistent structure so agents can load them reliably — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). CI enforces it: `validate-skills` fails any PR whose skill directories and manifest drift apart.
- **Security:** report vulnerabilities privately via [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md). This repo's own CI runs secret scanning on every push and PR, every workflow action is pinned to a commit SHA, and `main` is protected by required status checks.

## Credits

`blindspot`, `explain-diff`, and `pitch` implement patterns from [Thariq Shihipar's *"Finding Your Unknowns"*](https://thariqs.github.io/html-effectiveness/unknowns/) framework — blindspot passes, buy-in docs, and merge-gate quizzes.
